				in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, and geography from Kufa, Iraq.
				Born around 780 in Khwārizm (present-day Khiva, Uzbekistan) and died
				around 850 in Baghdad. For most of his life, he worked as a lecturer at
				the Honorary School in Baghdad founded by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Ma'mun
				bin Ar-Rashid, where he studied natural sciences and mathematics,
				including studying translations of Sanskrit and Greek manuscripts

						<h4 class="subtitle">Book 3: Planetarium Reconstruction,</h4>
						<p class="desc">
							His third famous book is the Kitāb rat al-Arḍ (Arabic: اب الأرض
							"Book of Sights of the World" or "Appearances of the Earth"
							translated by Geography), which was completed in 833 is a revision
							and refinement of Ptolemy's Geography, consisting of a list of

						<h4 class="subtitle">Book 4: Astronomy,</h4>
						<p class="desc">
							The book Zīj al-sindhind (Arabic: "astronomical tables") is a work
							consisting of 37 symbols on astronomical calendar calculations and
							116 tables with calendar, astronomical and astrological data as
							well as currently recognized data.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4 class="subtitle">Book 5: The Jewish Calendar,</h4>
						<p class="desc">
							Al-Khawārizmī also wrote about the Jewish Calendar (Risāla fi
							istikhrāj taʾrīkh al-yahd "Guidelines for the Jewish Calendar").

							governing what day of the week the month of Tishr begins.

						<h4 class="subtitle">Otehr Books,</h4>
						<p class="desc">
							Several Arabic manuscripts in Berlin, Istanbul, Tashkent, Cairo
							and Paris contain a material approach that probably comes from
							al-Khwarizmī. Manuscripts in Istanbul contain sundials, which are
							mentioned in the Fihirst. Other works, such as the determination
							of the direction of Mecca is one of spherical astronomy. Two works
							contain about morning (Ma'rifat sa'at al-mashriq fī kull balad)
							and determination of azimuth from height (Ma'rifat al-samt min
							qibal al-irtifā'). He also wrote 2 books on the use and assembly
							of the astrolabe. Ibn al-Nadim in his Kitab al-Fihrist (an index
							of Arabic) also mentions the Kitāb ar-Ruḵāma(t) (the sundial book)
							and the Kitab al-Tarikh (the history book) but the latter two are
							said to have been lost.

				"Khwarizmi's text is so different, not only from the Babylonian books, but also from Diophantus' Arithmatics. It is no longer a matter of a number of problems to solve, but a show that begins with simple terms whose combination gives all the possibilities for basic equations, which from now on is explicitly the correct object of study"
				<p>-- Rasheed and Armstrong --</p>
